# 20-20-20

If you are working with computer screens a lot, this is a simple Angular 2 project which will help you to reduce eye strain and eye fatigue.

## What is 20-20-20 rule?
**Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus your eyes on something at least 20 feet away.**

Information bar is counting first 20 minutes of your working time with computer screen:

Information bar change background for 20 seconds as a visual help to look away on object at least 20 feet away:

Cyclus repeat infinitely. If you leave and return, you can hit the reset button to reset the counter.    

## How to run it?

This project was generated with Angular CLI, so there is a lot of redundant code.

If you want just to use it, first download it and then just run in your terminal `ng serve` command. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` and have a browser opened during your work with the computer screen. The Angular app runs at port 5000, so you can develop other apps alongside ;) 
 
If you are new to running Angular apps here is [official documentation](https://angular.io/guide/setup) for how to run the Angular app.
