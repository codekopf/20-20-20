# 20-20-20

If you are working with computer screens a lot, this is a simple Angular 2 project which will help you to reduce eye strain and eye fatigue.

You can find a working example of this module [here](http://bit.ly/2FVKIu6).

## What is 20-20-20 rule?
**Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus your eyes on something at least 20 feet away.**

Information bar is counting first 20 minutes of your working time with computer screen:

Information bar change background for 20 seconds as a visual help to look away on object at least 20 feet away:

Loop repeat infinitely. If you leave and return, you can hit the reset button to reset the counter.    

## How to run it?

This project was generated with Angular CLI, so there is a lot of redundant code.

If you want to run module locally, first download it and then, if you have installed Angular CLI, just run in your terminal `ng serve` command in the download folder. Navigate to address `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser and have the tab opened during your work with the computer screen. 

If you want to develop other Angular apps alongside, rewrite port number in package.json or run `ng serve --port arbitrary_port_number`.  
 
If you are new to running Angular apps here is [official documentation](https://angular.io/guide/setup) for how to run the Angular app.

## Demo
I have build production version of this module and attached files into this GitHub repository. 
You can check this module straight from your browser anytime you want. Check the page http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/codekopf/20-20-20/blob/master/dist/index.html .
